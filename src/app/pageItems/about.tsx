                            Hi, I&apos;m Job, a {getAge()} year-old amateur devoloper, who likes to
                            code ones in a while. Most of the time I play sports or code a little.
                            Programming has always been something I liked and I hope that I can do
                            something with it. Still I don&apos;t know for sure what I want to do
                            later in life. Maybe I will join the military, maybe something with
                            sport or maybe I will stick to coding. Time will tell what will happen,
                            but until then I will continue to code things like this webiste.
                        </p>
